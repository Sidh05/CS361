Group 3
BLAKE DELEO, ANGEL ESTEBAN JASSO, CRISTIAN LOPEZ HERNANDEZ, SID MIDHA, ANDREW ROBERT ZIMMER

1. Availability for meeting expectations: 1 hour a week thorugh discord

2. Response time to communication expectations: 
    -Weekdays: 12 hours
    -Weekends: 24-48 hours

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it
in to github" is not done.):
    -Task is considered adequately completed once it is published on github for all members.

4. Adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation
updates):
    -Proper indentation
    -Proper commenting styles
    -proper nomenclature
    -proper snake-casing


5. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations:
    -Sometimes, life happens, and a team member might not be able to contribute as much as expected. 
     If that happens, they should let the group know ASAP so tasks can be reassigned based on the agreed system, 
     keeping everything running smoothly. If this keeps happening : 
     == A minor warning will be given first before any major action is taken. 
     == If things donâ€™t improve, the group might stop assigning work to them altogether due to a lack of reliability. 
     == Finally we will warn the member about informing the instructor about this behavior.

6. must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
