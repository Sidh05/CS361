Group 3
BLAKE DELEO, ANGEL ESTEBAN JASSO, CRISTIAN LOPEZ HERNANDEZ, SID MIDHA, ANDREW ROBERT ZIMMER

1. Availability for meeting expectations

2. Response time to communication expectations: 
    -Weekdays: 12 hours
    -Weekends: 24-48 hours

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it
in to github" is not done.):
    -Task is considered adequately completed once it is published on github for all members.

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting
minutes, updating task board)

5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation
updates)

6. if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here

7. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations:
    -Sometimes, life happens, and a team member might not be able to contribute as much as expected. 
     If that happens, they should let the group know ASAP so tasks can be reassigned based on the agreed system, 
     keeping everything running smoothly. If this keeps happening, though, it could lead to consequences depending on how serious it is. 
     A minor warning will be given first before any major action is taken. If things don’t improve, the group might stop assigning work to them altogether due to a lack of reliability. 
     That said, there’s always a chance to make things right—if the member consistently exceeds expectations for at least two weeks, they can regain full member status..

8. must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor

9. Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the
document.
